An enemy unit can never have more than 2 Judgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a unit would gain beyond this are ignored).
Each time a model from your army with this ability makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or more Judgement tokens, until that model\’s attacks have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from the table below to that attack.
1 Jodgement token - Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll
2 Judgement tokens - Now We’ve Got a Grudge to Settle: Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the Wound roll.`

- Incursion: 2 units
- Strike Force: 4 units
- Onslaught: 6 units
Each of those units start the battle with 2 Judgement tokens (see Eye of the Ancestors). If, at the start of any of your Command phases, any of those units have been destroyed, you gain a number of CP depending on how early in the battle you destroyed it, as shown below (you can only gain CP in this way once per battle, and CP gained in this way are an exemption to the Core Rules that limit the maximum number of CP you can gain per battle round to 1).
-Unit destroyed by the start of your first or second Command phase: 3CP
-Unit destroyed by the start of your third or fourth Command phase: 2CP
